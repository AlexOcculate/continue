<Info>
  Workflows are in beta. Please share any feedback with us in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/EfJEfdFnDQ).
</Info>

Workflows are a way to run and manage background agents in Continue. You can use them for:
- Addressing small nitpicks and bugs
- Building boilerplate-heavy features
- Investigating an issue to kickstart your work
- [Automated security scanning](../../guide/snyk-mcp-continue-cookbook.mdx)
- Running repeatable tasks with your own rules, prompts, and MCP servers
- Much more!

## Quickstart

To run your first workflow

1. Go to [hub.continue.dev/agents](https://hub.continue.dev/agents)

2. Connect with your GitHub account
3. Enter the prompt for your agent

## How to use background agents

The practice of using background agents, which we call Continuous AI, requires practice and forethought to set up the right guiderails and habits to fit your development workflow, much like learning to work with a larger engineering team. We are constantly sharing our learnings on the [Continuous AI Blog](https://blog.continue.dev), but these few high-level tips are a great way to quickly become successful with workflows:

- Practice first with the [Continue CLI](../../guides/cli) in "REPL mode". The same agent that powers our CLI is used for workflows, so you can easily test your prompts locally.
- Identify and begin with tasks that you are confident can be accomplished by Continue. For example, ask Continue to fix a small bug where you already know the solution is simple.
- Once you have merged a PR created by Continue, be increasingly ambitious with your tasks. By being willing to start tasks that might not succeed on the first try, you will learn about prompting best practices and limitations of current language models.
- Use thorough prompts. Workflows can run for a long time to complete their task, so it is worthwhile to invest in sharing all of the important details.
- Discuss the use of workflows with your team. Truly embracing Continuous AI likely means acknowledging that a higher volume of PRs will be created and adjusting your code review habits.
